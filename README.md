# Welcome to Elemental!
This lightweight application lets you spell out words and sentences using the elements of the periodic table as letters. The algorithm determines the option that has the most number of elements, and any letters left over (which do not have elements, such as the letter *a*) are left as regular English letters. 

The program is written in C++ and the GUI is built upon the Qt Framework using the Qt library. This is my first experience creating a Windows application with a graphical user interface and its motivation is actually as a gift for my high school chemistry teacher.
