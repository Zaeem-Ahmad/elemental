# Welcome to Elemental!
This lightweight application lets you spell out words and sentences using the elements of the periodic table as letters. The algorithm determines the option that has the most number of elements, and any letters left over (which do not have elements, such as the letter *a*) are left as regular English letters. The program is written in C++ and the GUI is built upon the Qt Framework using the Qt library. 

This is my first experience creating a Windows application with a graphical user interface and its motivation is actually as a gift for my high school chemistry teacher. I often saw her write little jokes and sayings on this whiteboard outside her lab, and she sometimes spelled things out using the elements. This program will make writing words in *periodic table* much easier and quicker.
